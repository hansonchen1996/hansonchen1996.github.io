I’m now a graduate student at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). My research interests are focused on [Person Re-identification](https://paperswithcode.com/task/person-re-identification) and [Image Retrieval](https://paperswithcode.com/task/image-retrieval).

I will move to [iFlytek](https://www.iflytek.com/index.html) mid next year, working as a Computer Vision Algorithm Engineer.
